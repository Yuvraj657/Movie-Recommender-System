# Movie Recommender System

## Overview
This project implements a Movie Recommender System using Python and machine learning techniques. The system suggests movies based on user preferences and past viewing history.

## Dataset
- The dataset used for this project contains movie titles, genres, user ratings, and other metadata.
- Data is preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical features, and normalize numerical values.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- NLTK
- Matplotlib (optional, for visualizations)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the notebook)

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk matplotlib
```

## Project Structure
- `Movie_Recommender.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation.
- `movies.csv`: Dataset file (if applicable).
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handling missing values.
   - Encoding categorical features.
   - Normalizing numerical features.
2. **Feature Extraction:**
   - Extracting features from movie metadata.
   - TF-IDF Vectorization for text-based features.
3. **Modeling:**
   - Similarity measures like Cosine Similarity for content-based filtering.
   - Collaborative Filtering (if implemented).
4. **Recommendation Generation:**
   - Generating top-N recommendations for a given user/movie.

## Results
- Provides personalized movie recommendations based on user inputs.
- Evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.


## Acknowledgments
- Inspired by popular recommendation systems like Netflix and Amazon Prime.
- Utilized datasets from open sources like Kaggle and MovieLens.
